1.4
upstraem aircrack changes fully addressed.

hostapd working for WPE attacks

Fixed very broken logic that had evolved in intiation processes in n4p_main.sh

Made changes to the ebuild.

Changed the logic of assigned processes to the at0 interface to relate only to an as needed task.

adjust SslStrip call process that allows it to be initiated individually without having to be built from an AP initiation with pre selected attack.

Modulerized existing N4P scripts

Broke out n4p_main.sh into segrigated scripts based on functions

Creatied module for Access Point creations

created the module for controlling bridge functions

created the module for DHCP functions

Fixed the code for adapter bridging (it's been broken for a while)

Added Hashcat functionality for cracking

Added .cap to hccap conversions

Added advanced user mode with shell interaction


1.3
Aircrack suit has made changes upstream that break n4p on live git builds of aircrack. This is marginally fixed here but still some bugs. Working on full comparability still.

1.2
Fixed a bug in the code and config that referenced variables as duplicates if both category's were not null when launching Airbase as a functional AP..

1.1 
Fixed the stuff 1.0 broke.


1.0
Syntax error in recon, bad indentation block

Lot of code changes for the the future of n4p but mean nothing to you.

Allowed recon to now check for rfkill lock

Fixed a bug with monitor device assignment when not using wlan0

Removed airmon-zc check kill, it's no longer needed

Changed install dir's of configs and logos due to Zero-Chaos excessively bitting my head off

Added ARP Spoofing support

Multiple monitoring capabilities added

Did away with fast options and help option

Moved firewall settings into its own script

Added reconisins for handshake based cracking

Added pcap cracking methods

Set basis for hostapd reintegration

Trimmed code further

Added logos

file name changes made


0.6
Added a kickstart script in front of the previous n4p.sh and renamed it to n4p_main.sh to work around an xdisplay issue.

Increased cognitive targeted logging

Fixed fast mode without bridging

Fixed occasional bug of route and ip assignments not being accepted to the AP

Fixed DHCP on some systems freely assigning bad routes

Adjusted ip and route commands adhering to new no wild card assignment standards

Moved attacks out for individual scripts

allowed users to specify interfaces during launch

allow users to adjust iprange of AP from dhcpd.conf

prepare to bring back hostapd for wider range of attacks

Fixed sym link conflict with the AP and DHCPD

Cleaned up execution verification script.

Changed some variable names for future scalability

0.5
Fixed firewall routing with bridging

Cleaned up loosely defined variables and variable structures

Updated find attributes to -wholename

Cleaned up error checking and improved error loops and added per process monitoring

Cleaned verbose outputs for easier follow along reading

Added -- switches/flags feature. e.g. n4p --help

Lot of code changes and additions. 
New methods of operations and package controll.

New less redundant more sane kill script logic

Removed dnsmasq - Was just too much for me to maintain and account for everyones boxes.

Changed ESSID to Pentoo

Changed some ip lease ranges on DHCPD

Added protection to prevent rfkill traps

More comprehensive text color usage.

added n4p_iptables.sh so iptables can be utilized without running n4p

Removed Hostapd. Was too hard for me to provide in production environment. Hostapd requires many config file 
attributes that are designed to be permanent on your box. If you want to use hostapd and not airbase then you're on your own.

Added path detection and absolute path relativeness for symlinking ability within ebuilds.

Moved dnsmasq settings into config file

0.1 10-25-2013
Alpha testing
